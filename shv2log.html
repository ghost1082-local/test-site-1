<H3>.: Space Hustle v2 Change Log...</h3>

<p align="justify">Since I decided to take this project up again, I felt I 
should log exactly what was done. Lots of features are planned and it will be a 
HUGE redesign code-wise. In addition, after reading several articles on the 
topic, I would like to make the finished game easy to add new content to. In 
light of that, some of my planning has gone toward modularizing certain parts. 
Should be interesting. Stay tuned... :) </p>

<H3><a name="8/3/2009"></a>.: 08 - 03 - 2009</h3>

<p align="justify">08/03/2009 - Prototyping is done!! Took a look at my existing 
code and stripped it down to the bare minimums.<br>
<br>
08/10/2009 - Engine updated!! Now using HGE 1.81. Lots of good fixes. A few 
new tools. Looks good.<br>
The 'Space Hustle State Manager<font face="Times New Roman">™'</font> has been implemented. Working pretty well. Its very 
general so I can throw anything at it and it will work. <br>
All initializations and &quot;shutdowns&quot; are being handled well. No memory leaks thus 
far.<br>
<br>
08/24/2009 - Most of the states have been created, placeholders mostly. Main 
menu is up and running and character creation is mostly done. <br>
Need to work in class/job perks as well as how the player stats affect play. <br>
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<H3><a name="9/14/2009"></a>.: 09 - 14 - 2009</h3>

<p align="justify">09/14/2009 - Basic ship functions are done. You can now go 
from the character creation to the ship to the first town.<br>
<br>
09/21/2009 - Some user testing was done, pulling up the main menu was missing :) 
... ESC now pulls up the main menu anytime. <br>
Pressing ESC again closes it (or alternately you can press &quot;Play&quot;). Started work 
on the shops.<br>
<br>
10/05/2009 - Town is shaping up pretty well. The item/goods shop is looking 
good. Interaction between the player stats, ship stats, and shop stats is 
working.<br>
(Meaning that shop has item quantities, player's trading stats and money amounts 
affect how much you can buy/sell, the ships total cargo space<br>
prevents the player from buying more that it can store, etc....)<br>
<br>
10/12/2009 - Black Market and Bank have been mostly completed. Need to make sure 
there are no weird bugs.<br>
Also bankTick() needs implementation. Cant do this till I start on the warping / 
ship flight stuff.<br>
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<H3><a name="11/9/2009"></a>.: 11 - 09 - 2009</h3>

<p align="justify">11/09/2009 - Some code cleanup and optimization has been 
done. Closed out a few minor bugs and finished up some features that were 
missing.<br>
Mostly from the shop/bm/bank areas and UI.<br>
<br>
11/16/2009 - Collision detection is up and working!!!!! No more walking all over 
buildings!<br>
Used a collision map. SH1 used a hard coded bounding box setup where if - 
PlayerX &amp; PlayerY were inside a particular &quot;box&quot; they would get bounced back.<br>
This used up a lot of code space and there was a lot of 'if' statements. Not 
very efficient, but it worked (and I was pressed for time).<br>
I did a lot of research on this subject and felt this was the best way to go. 
Player gets bounced back if the players X &amp; Y equal to a pixel in the <br>
collision map that is magenta (in my case). This allows way more precision and 
looks much better. Plus it only took about 6 lines of code.<br>
<br>
11/19/2009 - After checking my memory footprint for the project, I found a bug 
:( . Everything is being handled appropriately, except for one transition.<br>
Going from the ship to the town allocates about 4k in memory. Makes sense, 
pushed onto the state stack... adds onto the memory footprint. <br>
However, leaving the town back to the ship, which pops the state off the stack, 
there is only a 2k memory release. I'm leaking 2k somewhere?!?!<br>
</p>

<H3><br>
<a name="8/20/2010"></a>.: 8 - 20 - 2010</h3>

<p align="justify">8/20/2010 - Please excuse the lack of updates throughout the 
year. Between work and personal life, I haven't had much time to update my 
website.<br>
<br>
In any case, there has been a lot of really good progress on the title, most of 
the implementations are finished.<br>
Most of the states have been completed with a few minor details here and there 
that need to be polished up.<br>
All the artwork is mainly placeholder art and &quot;boxes&quot;. Planning to either find 
someone who is looking to help out, or do my best at re-iterating over the 
previous designs and cleaning them up.</p>
<p align="justify">Still need to do most of the sound and music implementation, 
but the barebones are there. Its just a matter of making the sound effects, 
adding in the code and testing it out.<br>
<br>
I think a mid next year release sounds pretty promising.<br>
</p>

<H3><br>
<a name="1/11/2010"></a>.: 1 - 11 - 2011</h3>

<p align="justify">1/11/2011 - Its been an interesting past few months. Work on 
the title has slowed a bit since I am now unemployed. Concentrating most of my 
efforts on finding a new career opportunity. Once I get some things in order, I 
should be able to resume work on the game. It should even make a good piece to 
have in my resume &quot;portfolio&quot;. I guess there is the silver lining... I'll have 
some more free time to really get into the graphics of the game and make it 
really polished.<br>
</p>
