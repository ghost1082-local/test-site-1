<H3>.: Projects...</h3>

<p align="justify">Listed below are a few projects that I have written recently.
<br>
.:Space Hustle ver.1 <br>
It was written for my class project and needed to be completed in a 3 month time period.  <br>
<em>[ Current Status: Prototype Completed ]</em> <br>

<br>

.:Space Hustle ver.2 <br>
This is my current project. Basically, its the same concept as ver.1 but the code is being re-written to include cut 
features and bugs are being fixed.  <br>
<em>[ Current Status: Shelved - Pending new engine investigation ]</em> <br>

<br>

.:Pencil Wars is based off an old paper and pencil game. Similar to shuffle board. <br>
<em>[ Current Status: Prototype Completed ] </em><br>

<br>

.:Sheep Doggin' is a project that was done during an Arkadium game Jam - LevelUp 2012. <br>
The theme of the game jam was symbiosis. We decided to play on the eco-system between grass - sheep - dog - wolf. <br>
<em>[ Current Status: Prototype Completed ] </em><br>

<br>

.:Crazy Lawnmower Revolution was a name generated by a name generator. It sounded fun, so this is a quick prototype.<br>
<em>[ Current Status: Shelved - Pending engine investigation ] </em><br>

<br>

.:Ninja Escape is a game idea I have been toying with for a while. Its a Cannabalt inspired game.<br>
<em>[ Current Status: Shelved - Pending engine investigation ]</em> <br>

<br>

.:100% Cranberry is a prototype that was done during a recent Arkadium game Jam - BossFight 2013. <br>
The basic premise of the game was that you were a flight attendant serving drinks. <br>
<em>[ Current Status: Prototype Completed ] </em><br>

<br>

At the very bottom is just a quick sample of 
miscellaneous, but often used programming topics. It uses some inheritance and 
templates and a few other frequently used coding structures.<br>
<em>[ Current Status: On-Going Updates ]</em></p>

<H3><a name="Space Hustle ver.1"></a>.: Space Hustle ver. 1</h3>

<p align="justify">Space Hustle is a hybrid mix of several game genres. It takes 
elements of the BBS game &quot;Planets&quot;, mixes in the PDA game &quot;Space Trader&quot;, and 
adds some parts of &quot;Freelancer&quot;. Basically, its little things that I liked in 
each of those games mixed all together to come up with the concept of Space 
Hustle.</p>
<p align="justify">Space Hustle was done during a 3 month &quot;sprint&quot; for my 
graduation project. 
Since time was a constraint, the code was done with speed in mind, not 
flexibility. <br>
There are several features that I wanted to include but had to cut. Things that 
are disabled will have a message saying that it is not implemented yet. There 
was a quick bug bash done on it, but there may still be some UI bugs and 
animation timing issues.<br>
In addition to this, the save and load game had some bugs in it and was disabled 
prior to handing in my project.<br>
<br>
How To Play:<br>
Most of the game is played using the mouse and clicking on buttons that are on 
the screen.<br>
When in the towns or space station, you must use the arrow keys to move your 
character to where you want him to go.<br>
To start:<br>
Start a new game, type in the name of your character, select next and distribute 
your initial points (NOTE: You must allocate all points to move on).<br>
From the ship screen your options are warping to another planet, exiting out to 
the town, or pulling up the command console.<br>
The command console buttons have been disabled do to the lack of time. To close 
the console press the red button on the top left of the console.<br>
Warping to another planet is as easy as clicking where you want to go and 
pressing &quot;warp&quot;.<br>
Exit out to the town by pressing the exit sign on the bottom right of the ship 
screen.<br>
In town, from the top left going clockwise, is the warehouse, trading shop, 
black market, ship dealer, and the ship repair/upgrade shop.</p>

<H3><a name="Space Hustle ver.2"></a>.: Space Hustle ver. 2</h3>

<p align="justify">This is version 2 of Space Hustle. Basically, it takes the 
concept of what was done in version 1 and starts 
from scratch. Its currently still in progress and will be reusing the same graphics, 
but it will have some new features added in.<br>
I have completely redone the structure. It now follows a more efficient and 
robust design - a stack of states that can be pushed or popped depending on what 
the user is doing. I felt this was the way to go since its more flexible and 
versatile.</p>
<p align="justify">Since this project has only been in the works for a brief 
amount of time, many features have not been implemented yet.</p>
<p align="justify">Below is the current state diagram and class diagram, this 
may change as more features are added.<br>
Also you will find some sample code of how I am handling the states, along with 
a template of how most of the states look.</p>

<H3><a name="Pencil Wars"></a>.: Pencil Wars</h3>

<p align="justify">
The game concept is based on a game played with pencils. Two or
more players will play with pencils on a pad of paper.
<br>
First they will each draw circles
on the two sides of the paper. 
<br>
One player will make a move, then the other. The goal is
to move through the other players circle.
</p>
<p align="justify">In this version, players have access to various powerup. 
<br>
There is also bonus pieces that award more points.
<p align="justify">
Powerups:
<br>
Accuracy - When a player applies this powerup to a piece, the piece will have a constant velocity.
<br>
This allows the player to make more precise shots by not having to worry about the speed of thier movement.
<br><br>
Growth - When a player applies this powerup to a piece, the piece will double in size.
<br>
This allows the player to potentially hit multiple targets easier.
<br><br>
Breakthrough - When a player applies this powerup to a piece, the piece will get a speed boost.
<br>
Additionally, the piece will bounce off walls and pass through multiple pieces.
<br>
This allows the player to make trick shots and hit multiple pieces.

<H3><a name="Sheep Dog"></a>.: Sheep Doggin'</h3>

<p align="justify">
At an Arkadium game jam - LevelUP 2012, everyone split into teams of 5 and had 2 days to prototype a game based off the theme of symbiosis.<br>
Our team - PsychoSwarm - had several great ideas but ultimately settled on what is now know as "Sheep Doggin'". <br>
Sheep Doggin' is a semi-top down, semi-isometric game where the basic premise is that the player controls the sheep dog to herd sheep around a field. <br>
The player earns points based upon how much grass is eaten by the end of the day.<br>
Throughout this time, a wolf appears and tries to eat your sheep. It is up to you to herd your flock away from the wolf. <br>
Each successful defence earns you points, while each unsuccessful defence will lose you points. <br>
<em>Pictures coming soon...</em>

<H3><a name="CLR"></a>.: Crazy Lawnmower Revolution</h3>

<p align="justify">
I came across a rather amuzing Game Name Generator. This one was particularly interesting so I decided to create a quick protoype of the game. <br>
The idea that I came up with for the game was that for some unknown reason, lawnmowers have become sentient and are terrorizing the neighborhood! <br>
It is up to the player to find out why and put a stop to the madness...<br>
I decided to go with an adventure game type mechanic with investigation and RPG style elements to add some depth.<br>
<em>Pictures and link coming soon...</em>
<br>

<br>
</p>

<H3><a name="Ninja Escape"></a>.: Ninja Escape</h3>

<p align="justify">
Concept of the game is a twist on Cannabalt. You control a ninja that is traversing a level.<br>
A sense of urgency is imparted because something(WIP) is always behind you chasing you. <br>
As you go through the level you must jump over obstacles and dispatch enemies that appear before you. <br>
Killing enemies earns you experience points that you can use to gain new abilities or level up existing ones. <br>
Along the way the player will also be able to pick up various weapons or powerups.<br>
<br>

<br>
</p>

<H3><a name="100 Cranberry"></a>.: 100% Cranberry</h3>

<p align="justify">
At an Arkadium game jam - BossFight 2013, everyone split into teams of 5 again and had 2 days to prototype a game based off a given game idea.<br>
Our team was tasked to create a fun and interesting game based off of the idea that you are a flight attendant serving drinks on a flight.<br>
We took this idea and just ran with it. We decided that the airline ONLY served cranberry juice. We also went with the mechanic that invloved <br>
the use of a tablet accelerometer. <br>
You steer the attendants cart back and forth to stop at a passenger. This begins the juice filling "stage". <br>
You tilt the tablet left to right to adjust the velocity at which the juice flows out of the carton. <br>
If you run out of juice, you need to refill back at your station. 5 successful juice pours will win the game. <br>
Out of about 20 games, our game took home the "Most Creative" trohphy. <br>

<p align="justify">Just some sample code that shows the use of:<br>
Abstract Classes<br>
Virtual Functions<br>
Static and Dynamic pointers<br>

Operator Overloading<br>
And some Inheritance</p>
