<H3>.: About Me...</h3>

<p align="justify"><b>Name:</b> Chris Liguz<b><br>
Bio: </b>I was born in 1982 and got my first gaming system probably at about 6. It 
was the Atari 2600 (which I still have today - and in working condition). This 
started me on the path as the gamer I am today. I have owned almost every system 
out there since then.</p>
<p align="justify">On the computer side, I think I got my first computer when I 
was in elementary school. It was a &quot;top of the line&quot; 386. I guess maybe that is 
why I have always preferred using command line over GUI's. Around that time I 
started my PC gaming career. It was 4d boxing, A-10 Tank Killer, Lemmings, and 
of course Space Quest I.</p>
<p align="justify">Moving a little further down the time line into high school, 
I have always been interested in technology and had a very deeply rooted passion 
for games. It was around this time that I began thinking of games as something I 
can design, but the closest I ever came were the &quot;build your own D&amp;D adventure&quot; 
type games. It wasn't until I hit college and had my first programming class did 
it finally all click. Around 2002 I had my first C/C++ programming class. I have 
been learning about game design and how to code games ever since. This is 100%, 
without a doubt, the industry I want to be in.<br>
<br>
Currently I am working on some independent projects and happily employed at EA.</p>

<H3>.: Why I am better than the other guy</h3>

<p align="justify">I am one of the rare few that loves coding. <br>
I code for fun. I code whenever I have spare time. <br>
I feel that this shows that I have plenty of promise and strong determination to not only work 
but thrive in a field that really intrigues me. </p>
<p align="justify">In addition I enjoy learning about new techniques and 
implementations and try to integrate those ideas into my code.<br>
By constantly keeping up on new topics, it allows me to keep my skills sharp. 
This allows me to bring a real, tangible, useful skill set to the table. A skill 
set that allows me to enhance and support the team.<br>
When you are doing something you love you cant help but fully immerse yourself 
in it. Due to this, I have always been quick learner. Whenever I am faced with 
an unknown codebase, I try to learn as much as I can about it. This not only 
lets me know what &quot;tools&quot; I have available to me, but also gives me the chance 
to learn new implementation techniques and learn the style of the code.<br>
<br>
In summation, I enjoy challenges and finding solutions to those challenges is 
immensely rewarding for me.<br>
To aide in this, I try to design my code to be as expandable as possible. This 
allows my code to be applied to various problems and can be integrated with 
minimal modification. Why re-invent the wheel when all it needs is a new hub 
cap?</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<H3>.: Games</h3>

<p align="justify">What I like in a game:</p>
<p align="justify">First and foremost - Game play. It has to be fun to play, 
otherwise, what is the point? A game with a well designed and highly polished 
game mechanic speaks volumes about the game.<br>
I find myself enjoying games that are challenging and have a steep learning 
curve or require strategy. Mindless running and gunning, while fun, tends to get 
a bit stale after a few hours.<br>
In addition to this, games with engaging stories are always high on my list. The 
story does not necessarily have to be something I can relate to, but something 
that keeps you playing just because you want to find out what happens next. <br>
A few of my favorites are listed below, but I feel that FF:Tactics for the PSX 
best showcases what I look for in a game. The story was very well written, the 
battles were turn based and required thought and planning, and I absolutely 
loved the whole job point experience system. Picking various primary and 
secondary classes allowed for a highly customized character.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently Playing:</p>
<p align="justify">
Rocket League - PC<br>
Mass Effect 3 - X360<br>
Disgaea 4 - PS3<br>
Factorio - PC<br>
<a href="http://www.progressquest.com">Progress Quest</a> - PC</p>
