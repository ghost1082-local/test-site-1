Description of position:
Arkadium, a premier developer, publisher, and distributor of casual, social, Windows, and mobile games, has a unique career growth opportunity for a qualified senior game programmer to lead development on upcoming games in New York City.

This is an amazing opportunity to: 

    Develop high quality new games with an experienced team and a solid support system.
    Lead agile teams of programmers in New York and foreign offices in development of complex projects.
    Be a communication leader. Motivate and guide artists, project managers, and designers to create the best product possible.
    Work with back-end developers to create connected social games that bring people together.
    Share your own depth and breadth of experience, as well as research new technologies and processes to help all programmers be better.
    Challenge yourself and your team to create engaging, viral, and polished games that will mold the gaming landscape as you see fit.
    Work with a company that has the stability and resources of a big player with the spirit and flexibility of a start-up.
    Champion high standards in architecture, patterns, reusable code, and best practices.
    Leverage your knowledge and expertise in game programming to help guide all game programming practices at Arkadium.

What you need to be successful in this role: 

    You'll be working with people who are passionate about creating engaging, fun games, so you should be too!
    We are in the business of making games, so having previous game development experience will help you hit the ground running.
    A solid foundation in object oriented programming is essential for writing polished, bug-free games. With at least 5 years under your belt, you'll have the best chance of success.
    If you're an expert in Flash/AS3, Unity/C#, or HTML5/JavaScript, it means that we speak the same language. If you’re familiar with more than one, that’s even better!
    Today’s games are all about connecting players, so it’s more important than ever to have experience working with back-end services, especially the Facebook API.
    We hire great programmers who enjoy working closely together in building awesome games. If you are ambitious and are looking to work with an experienced team of software engineers, you will feel right at home with us.
    At Arkadium, we love to celebrate our success. If you take pride in your work, you'll fit right in!

In addition to this being a unique career opportunity, we offer: 

    An opportunity to work with a Company that has the stability and resources of a big player and spirit and flexibility of a start up
    Competitive base salary and full benefits
    Work - life balance
    An opportunity to work with talented and passionate people
